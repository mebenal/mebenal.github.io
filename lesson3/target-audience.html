               groups seeking to do outdoor activities or plan camping trips in 
               the next couple days, to farmers relying on the weather to plan 
               their weekly schedules, to prospecive residents looking to see long 
               term weather patterns, and more.</p>
            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <h3>John</h3>
            <p>John is an average blue collar worker who enjoys spending his free
               time outside. He often checks the weather to plan his weekend activites.
               When he does so, he wants to see temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.
            </p>
            <h3>Sarah</h3>
            <p>Sarah is a single mother with two children. She is currently looking to move,
               and a crucial factor for her is climate. She wants to see long term trends in
               weather, as well as past notable storm/weather events.
            </p>
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <h3>Tourists</h3>
            <p>A tourist is checking the weather to see if it will be worth stopping in this
               area for a picnic and family outing in a week. Wants to check temperature and
               chance of precipitation.
            </p>
            <h3>Farmers</h3>
            <p>One local farmer needs to harvest his crop within the next two weeks, but
               also wants to let it grow as much as possible. He needs to see chance of
               precipitation and if there are any storms presicted to come through
            </p>
            <h3>Residents</h3>
            <p>A local resident jogs with a friend every week. He checks the weather to
               check odds of precipitation and whether it will be cold enough for ice to
               form. Also checks humidity.
            </p>
            <h3>Boy Scouts</h3>
            <p>Check weather regularly to plan outdoor activities and camping trips. Need
               to be able to check weather in a fairly wide area. Mostly concerned about 
               storms, however temperature and precipitation is useful as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Prospective Residents</h3>
            <p>Looking for a new place of residence. They're less concerned about the weather
               in a day or even in a week, but wants to be able to see past weather to see if the
               climate will fit within their criteria.
