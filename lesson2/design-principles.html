                <p>Squarespace</p>
                <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">https://www.squarespace.com/</a>
                <div class="imgDiv"><img src="images/squarespace.jpg" alt="Squarespace's mobile home page."></div>
                <p>As part of Squarespaces's buisness model is to provide a framework to design stunning websites, 
                    it's no surprise that their own homepage is beautifully designed and includes many good design 
                    principles. I specifically chose to focus on visual hierarchy because it was immediately clear 
                    what I was supposed to focus on when I opened the page. I first read the title and then jumped
                    directly to the button. From there I transitioned to the examples in the bottom right and finished
                    by reading the heading under the title. This same type of design also occurs when scrolling down,
                    directly leading my eyes through the hierarchy they created. I really liked their design in general
                    for its simplicity and ability to lead my eye in a logical way without having to directly spell it out.</p>

                <div class="boxTop"><h3>Hick's Law</h3></div>
                <p>McMaster-Carr</p>
                <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/">https://www.mcmaster.com/</a>
                <div class="imgDiv"><img src="images/mcmaster-carr.jpg" alt="McMaster-Carr's mobile home page."></div>
                <p>In many ways, McMaster-Carr's web design is dated and non-responsive, however there is one element in 
                    which I believe they excel. McMaster-Carr sells over 550,000 items, and yet to narrow down a search is 
                    extremely easy. Despite having many options, none of them are really comperable in a way that requires
                    much thought. In addition, each category, even going down to individual items, has pictures and descriptions
                    to help users find what they need. Once an initial category is selected, the filter menu on the left is
                    extremely useful in helping narrow down what is needed. Many of the filters also have illustrations or 
                    descriptions which also aid the user. I think the design overall is especially suited for McMaster-Carr's
                    userbase, who tend to be purpose driven and already know what they are looking for, only needing to find it.</p>

                <div class="boxTop"><h3>Repetition</h3></div>
                <p>Wikipedia</p>
                <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">https://www.wikipedia.org/</a>
                <div class="imgDiv"><img src="images/wikipedia.jpg" alt="Wikipedia's mobile home page."></div>
                <p>Wikipedias's design is simple and repetative. Whether on their home page or countless articles, their design
                    repeats colors, styles, and layouts frequently. This repetition makes it extremely easy to navigate through 
                    pages to find relevent information. Their style and repetition leads to a very recognizable site. Even on
                    their home page there are nine repeated elements, with each one changing only the language it is displayed in.
                    Commonly repeating elements of a wikipedia page include text formatting, the table of contents, fact boxes on 
                    the right of the screen, and the menu on the left. Overall, Wikipedia's design is extremely repetative, which
                    helps to make them recognizeable and easy to navigate.
